Object detection with pre-trained Yolor model

In this project I used YOLOR to detect objects on image and video files. YOLOR is a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm for object detection, different from YOLOv1-YOLOv5 due to the difference in authorship, architecture, and model infrastructure. YOLOR stands for “You Only Learn One Representation”, not to be confused with YOLO versions 1 through 4, where YOLO stands for “You Only Look Once”. YOLOR is specifically for object detection, rather than other machine learning use cases such as object identification or analysis. This is because object detection is focused around the general identifiers which make the object fall under a certain category or class. In contrast, other types of machine learning use cases require more exact processes. Object identification requires the machine learning model to be attuned to the range of nuances that would constitute objects from each other.
